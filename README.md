# Interactive Evolution for Melody Generation

This is an interactive evolutionary system for the creation
of short human-pleasing musical compositions. 

It is achieved through a genetic algorithm (GA): a
population of melodic and rhythmic lines is evolved dependently
on the evaluation of a human user. Although naÄ±ve, the system
demonstrates to produce meaningful and interesting results.

This project was developed for the *Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence* course at University of Trento.
